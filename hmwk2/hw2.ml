let term1 : term = Until (Up ("x", 2), Until (Up ("y", 4), Eq ("y", 9)));;

(* answer to problem 1:  *)

(* "term" is defined as a variant type, meaning it can have multiple constructors.
The three constructors defined are:
  - "Until of term * term" that takes two "term" values and represents an "until"
  operation which may be a loop checking a value while not some value.
  - "Eq of string * int" that takes a string and an int as arguments and 
  represents an equality comparison.
  - "Up of string * int" that takes a string and an int as arguments and 
  represents an "up" operation, which is undefined but which seems to b
  e an exponentiation operation, a string concatenantion operation, 
  or potentially a value comparison.

Starting from the inside out, we have an Up and a Eq operation nestest as
parameters for an Until operation.  The result of this is used as the second
parameter to another Until operation, with the remaining Up operation as the 
second parameter.

Assuming Up performs "+=" style addition... In english:  Keep adding 4 to "y"
to "y" equals 9.  Using this result Keep adding 2 to "x" until the nested 
operation completes and returns a result. *)


(* problem 3 *)
(* for i from 2 do i âˆ§ 1 until i = 10 *)
let my_term : term =
  For ("i", 2, Until (Up ("i", 1), Eq ("i", 10)))
